    #environment:
      
      # To select your concentrator you have 3 options:
      # Option 1: set the MODEL to the device model number (i.e. RAK7371)
      # Option 2: set the MODEL to the concentrator model number (i.e. RAK5146, WM1302, R11E-LR8...)
      # Option 2: set the MODEL to the concentrator chip (i.e. SX1303)
      #MODEL: "RAK5146"
      #MODEL: "SX1303"

      # The interface the concentrator uses, either "SPI", "USB" or "AUTO". 
      # Use "AUTO" coupled with device auto-discover feature below. Defaults to "SPI".
      #INTERFACE: "AUTO"

      # If you have the concentrator connected to a different port than the default one 
      # ("/dev/spidev0.0" for SPI or "/dev/ttyACM0" for USB) you can define here.
      # Set it to "AUTO" for auto-discover (works only with Corecell concentrators).
      #DEVICE: "/dev/spidev0.1"
      #DEVICE: "/dev/ttyACM0"
      #DEVICE: "AUTO"

      # When using auto-discover feature the search will stop after the first concentrator it finds,
      # you can change this behaviour by setting RADIO_NUM to any other value.
      #RADIO_NUM: 1

      # GPIO to reset SPI concentrators (these are the defaults)
      #USE_LIBGPIOD: 0 # set to 1 by default for Raspberry Pi 5
      #GPIO_CHIP: "gpiochip0" # set to "gpiochip4" by default for Raspberry Pi 5
      #RESET_GPIO: 17
      #POWER_EN_GPIO: 0
      #POWER_EN_LOGIC: 0

      # Problems with an SPI concentrator are sometimes related to the bus speed,
      # you can set a different one this way
      #SPI_SPEED: 8000000

      # Define whether the device has a GPS or LTE connectivity (legacy)
      #HAS_GPS: "0"
      #HAS_LTE: "0"
      
      # Same for the GPS
      #GPS_DEV: "/dev/i2c-1"
      #GPS_DEV: "/dev/ttyUSB1"

      # Each gateway is identified by tis Gateway EUI (8 bytes in hex format)
      # The procedure to defined that EUI is as follows:
      # 1) It will use the concentrator Chip ID if GATEWAY_EUI_SOURCE set to "chip" (will work only for Corecell and 2g4 concentrators)
      # 2) It will use the GATEWAY_EUI variable below if defined
      # 3) It will use the MAC address of the network interface identified by GATEWAY_EUI_SOURCE
      # 4) It will use the MAC address of the first existing network interface in this list: eth0, wlan0 and usb0
      # 5) It will use the MAC address of the network interface with more traffic
      # For options 3 to 5 you want to use network mode host to get the same EUI accross container reboots
      #GATEWAY_EUI_SOURCE: "enx00e04c68160f"
      #GATEWAY_EUI_SOURCE: "chip"

      # The default LNS server is the European TTN server. 
      # If you still want to use TTN but a different region you can set it this way:
      #TTN_REGION: "au1"

      # Or you can set a completely different LNS server.
      #SERVER_HOST: lns.example.com
      #SERVER_PORT: 1700

      # The default frequency band is EU868, 
      # if your module uses a different band you have to select it here:
      #BAND: "cn_470_510"

      # If you want the gateway to report a specific lat/lon/alt you can set them this way:
      #GPS_LATITUDE: 41.42
      #GPS_LONGITUDE: 2.12
      #GPS_ALTITUDE: 0
